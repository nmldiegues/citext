Article Citation extractor from pdfs
============

* Allows to extract the references from a scientific article in PDF.
* Provides the context of the citation, i.e., the body of the text where the reference is used.

I have used this in personal projects to create a graph of citations among the related work of my research. This way, I could easily fetch, for instance, what other authors said when they cited some paper that I also wanted to cite now.
